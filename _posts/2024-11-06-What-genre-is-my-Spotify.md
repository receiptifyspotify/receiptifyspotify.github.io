# What genre is my Spotify?

Unfortunately, Spotify doesn't directly provide a specific genre label for your overall listening habits. However, you can get a good idea of your primary genres by:

## Checking Your Top Genres:

Spotify Wrapped: This annual feature provides a detailed breakdown of your listening habits, including your top genres.
Third-Party Apps: Tools like Stats for Spotify can give you a more detailed analysis of your listening history, including genre breakdowns.

##Analyzing Your Playlists:


Look at the genres of the songs in your playlists to get a sense of your musical preferences.
Spotify often categorizes playlists by genre, so you can see which genres you tend to listen to most.

## Using Spotify's Genre-Based Recommendations:

Spotify's algorithm suggests music based on your listening history. Pay attention to the genres of the recommended songs and playlists. Â  
While Spotify doesn't provide a single, definitive genre label, these methods can give you a clear picture of your musical tastes.
