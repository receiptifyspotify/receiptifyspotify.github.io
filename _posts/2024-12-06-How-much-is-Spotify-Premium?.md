# How much is Spotify Premium?

Spotify offers various Premium plans with different pricing options. Here are the current plans available in India:   

**Premium Individual:** This is the standard plan for individual users. It offers ad-free listening, offline playback, and on-demand playback.   

**Premium Duo:** This plan is designed for couples living at the same address. It offers two individual Premium accounts at a discounted price.   

**Premium Family:** This plan is ideal for families. It allows up to six family members to have their own Premium accounts, all under one family plan.   

**Premium Student:** This plan is exclusively for students and offers a discounted rate.   

To get the most accurate and up-to-date pricing information, I recommend checking Spotify's official website or app. Prices may vary depending on your region and any ongoing promotions.
