# What age is Spotify for?

## Spotify's Age Restrictions

Spotify is designed for users aged 13 and older. For users under the age of 18, parental consent is required. This ensures a safe and appropriate listening experience, especially for younger users.   

For children under 13, Spotify offers a separate app called Spotify Kids. This child-friendly app provides a curated selection of music, podcasts, and audiobooks, designed specifically for young listeners. It offers a safe and fun environment, free from explicit content and tailored to their interests.   

By implementing these age restrictions and providing a dedicated platform for younger children, Spotify aims to create a positive and age-appropriate listening experience for all users.
